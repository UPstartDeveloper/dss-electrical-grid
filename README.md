# dss-electrical-grid

In this project, we will be using data on electricity consumption, electricity prices, and power outages to build a machine learning model that can predict future electricity usage and power outages. We will also use data on weather and socioeconomic factors in our analysis.

This project is part of the Data Science Society at Berkeley's General Membership Program.

Data:

Electricity consumption: http://www.ercot.com/gridinfo/load/load_hist

Electricity prices: http://www.ercot.com/mktinfo/prices (use one of the historical prices dataset)

Power Outages: http://insideenergy.org/2014/08/18/data-explore-15-years-of-power-outages/ and https://www.oe.netl.doe.gov/OE417_annual_summary.aspx
